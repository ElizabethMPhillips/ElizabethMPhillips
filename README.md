I am on the [Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies (FEAT) Team](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/sustainable-fisheries/fisheries-engineering-and-acoustic-technologies-team) at NWFSC. I conduct research to support sustainable management of Pacific hake, with an emphasis on fisheries acoustics methods, linking  ocean conditions and prey abundance to hake diet, growth, and distribution, and integrating ecological monitoring of zooplankton, seabirds and marine mammals into the [joint US-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Acoustic-Trawl Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/joint-us-canada-integrated-ecosystem-and-pacific-hake-acoustic-trawl-survey), in support of ecosystem-based fisheries management.
