Research Fish Biologist, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries<br>

I am on the [Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies (FEAT) Team](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/sustainable-fisheries/fisheries-engineering-and-acoustic-technologies-team) at NWFSC. My work involves quantifying linkages between dynamic physical ocean conditions and multiple trophic levels including zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. I am currently working on standardizing approaches to classify euphausiids (krill) from acoustic backscatter, assessing the relationships between krill and Pacific hake distribution, diet, growth, and recruitment, and adding seabird and marine mammal surveys to the [joint US-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Acoustic-Trawl Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/joint-us-canada-integrated-ecosystem-and-pacific-hake-acoustic-trawl-survey) in support of fisheries management. My work also supports the Pacific hake Management Strategy Evaluation, and the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment.
